The video demo on a video that is outside of our training/dev/testing data set.

The baseline model contains the code cloned from an existing implementation
(https://github.com/tkuanlun350/Tensorflow-SegNet) for
SegNet (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561v3.pdf). 

We will start from the baseline mode and build our lane detection model.
